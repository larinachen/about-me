# About me
Hi :)) I'm Larina, a sophomore at Northwestern University studying CS

**I see CS as a creative medium and a tool to make some really cool stuff,** for fun and for possibily making an impact on the world around me. Currently, I'm learning C/C++ and JS in school and doing some Python, AI, and web projects on the side.
